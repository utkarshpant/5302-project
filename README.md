# 5302 Final Project

## This is the code for the ASDS 5302 final project presented by Utkarsh Pant and Soham Neeraj Agarkar on Nov. 21, 2023.

Written in R, we conduct exploratory data analysis on the [Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Original)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/15/breast+cancer+wisconsin+original) dataset.

On the cleaned data, we trained an ensemble model (Log. Reg., Decision Tree, SVM and KNN base models + Log. Reg. meta-model) to classify an observation as _malignant (2)_ or _benign. (4)_

## To reproduce our results

1. Clone this repository in a suitable directory on your machine.
2. `cd` into the repository (that is, navigate to the repository), and open `FInal Project.R` (apologies for the MIstake in the name!) in RStudio.
3. Once open, hit Run in RStudio (or your IDE of choice), and the script executes, generating the relevant graphics and tables for you to inspect.
